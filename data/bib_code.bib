	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation threatens global biodiversity. To date, there is
 only limited understanding of how the different aspects of habitat
 fragmentation (habitat loss, number of fragments and isolation) affect
 species diversity within complex ecological networks such as food webs.
 Here, we present a dynamic and spatially-explicit food web model which
 integrates complex food web dynamics at the local scale and
 species-specific dispersal dynamics at the landscape scale, allowing us to
 study the interplay of local and spatial processes in metacommunities. We
 here explore how the number of habitat patches, i.e. the number of
 fragments, and an increase of habitat isolation, affect the species
 diversity patterns of complex food webs (alpha-, beta-, gamma-diversity).
 We specifically test whether there is a trophic dependency in the effect
 of these two factors on species diversity. In our model, habitat isolation
 is the main driver causing species loss and diversity decline. Our results
 emphasise that large-bodied consumer species at high trophic positions go
 extinct faster than smaller species at lower trophic levels, despite being
 superior dispersers that connect fragmented landscapes better. We
 attribute the loss of top species to a combined effect of higher biomass
 loss during dispersal with increasing habitat isolation in general, and
 the associated energy limitation in highly fragmented landscapes,
 preventing higher trophic levels to persist. To maintain trophic-complex
 and species-rich communities calls for effective conservation planning
 which considers the interdependence of trophic and spatial dynamics as
 well as the spatial context of a landscape and its energy availability.},

	abstract = {1. The feeding functional response is one of the most widespread mathematical frameworks in Ecology, Marine Biology, Freshwater Biology, Microbiology and related scientific fields describing the resource-dependent uptake of a consumer. Since the exact knowledge of its parameters is crucial to predict, for example, the efficiency of biocontrol agents, population dynamics, food web structure and subsequently biodiversity, a trustworthy parameter estimation method is highly important for scientists using this framework. Classical approaches for estimating functional response parameters lack flexibility and often only provide approximations of the correct parameters. 2. Here, we combined ordinary differential equation (ODE) models that were numerically solved using computer simulations with an iterative maximum likelihood fitting approach. We compared our method to classical approaches of fitting functional responses using data both with and without additional resource growth and mortality. 3. We found that for classical functional response models, such as the frequently used type II and type III functional responses, the established fitting methods are reliable. However, by using more complex and flexible functional responses, our new method outperforms the traditional methods. Additionally, our method allows the incorporation of side effects such as resource growth and background mortality. 4. Our method will enable researchers from different scientific fields who are measuring functional responses to calculate more accurate parameter estimates. These estimates will enable community ecologists to parameterize their models more precisely, thus allowing a deeper understanding of complex ecological systems, and will increase the quality of ecological prediction models.},
