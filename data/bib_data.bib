	abstract = {1. The ecological implications of body size extend from the biology of individual organisms to ecosystem–level processes. Measuring body mass for high numbers of invertebrates can be logistically challenging, making length-mass regressions useful for predicting body mass with minimal effort. However, standardised sets of scaling relationships covering a large range in body length, taxonomic groups, and multiple geographical regions are scarce. 2. We collected 6212 arthropods from 19 higher-level taxa in both temperate and tropical locations to compile a comprehensive set of linear models relating live body mass to a range of predictor variables. We measured live weight (hereafter, body mass), body length and width of each individual and conducted linear regressions to predict body mass using body length, body width, taxonomic group and geographic region. Additionally, we quantified prediction discrepancy when using parameters from arthropods of a different geographic region. 3. Incorporating body width into taxon- and region-specific length-mass regressions yielded the highest prediction accuracy for body mass. Using regression parameters from a different geographic region increased prediction discrepancy, causing over- or underestimation of body mass depending on geographical origin and whether body width was included. 4. We present a comprehensive range of parameters for predicting arthropod body mass and provide guidance for selecting optimal scaling relationships. Given the importance of body mass for functional invertebrate ecology and the paucity of adequate regressions to predict arthropod body mass from different geographical regions, our study provides a long-needed resource for quantifying live body mass in invertebrate ecology research.},

	abstract = {With the world continuously warming, a mechanistic understanding of how temperature affects interaction strengths, which are fundamental to food-web stability, is needed. As interaction strengths are determined by the flows of energy from resources to consumers, we investigated effects of temperature on animal energetics. We used newly compiled datasets on respiration rates and assimilation efficiencies to assess how temperature affects the energy use (respiration rates) and the efficiency of energy gain (assimilation efficiency) for different consumer types. Furthermore, we incorporated our findings in a simulation of temperature effects on maintenance feeding rates (i.e. energy consumption necessary to sustain life). Our analysis revealed a generally positive temperature dependence of assimilation efficiencies across consumer types thus implying a net energy gain with warming. The temperature scaling of respiration rates did not differ between consumer types. Based on these parameters we calculated maintenance feeding rates and compared them to empirically measured (realized) feeding rates. This comparison revealed that detritivores and herbivores have the potential to increase their biomasses under warming as their maintenance feeding rates increase less strongly than their realized feeding rates. For carnivores, however, we found a stronger increase of their maintenance feeding rates compared to their realized feeding rates, which should lead to decreased population sizes under warming. Overall, our results increase the understanding of climate change effects on ecosystems as they suggest profound energetic consequences for natural communities.},

	abstract = {1. The feeding functional response is one of the most widespread mathematical frameworks in Ecology, Marine Biology, Freshwater Biology, Microbiology and related scientific fields describing the resource-dependent uptake of a consumer. Since the exact knowledge of its parameters is crucial to predict, for example, the efficiency of biocontrol agents, population dynamics, food web structure and subsequently biodiversity, a trustworthy parameter estimation method is highly important for scientists using this framework. Classical approaches for estimating functional response parameters lack flexibility and often only provide approximations of the correct parameters. 2. Here, we combined ordinary differential equation (ODE) models that were numerically solved using computer simulations with an iterative maximum likelihood fitting approach. We compared our method to classical approaches of fitting functional responses using data both with and without additional resource growth and mortality. 3. We found that for classical functional response models, such as the frequently used type II and type III functional responses, the established fitting methods are reliable. However, by using more complex and flexible functional responses, our new method outperforms the traditional methods. Additionally, our method allows the incorporation of side effects such as resource growth and background mortality. 4. Our method will enable researchers from different scientific fields who are measuring functional responses to calculate more accurate parameter estimates. These estimates will enable community ecologists to parameterize their models more precisely, thus allowing a deeper understanding of complex ecological systems, and will increase the quality of ecological prediction models.},

	abstract = {The effect of climate change on the amount of carbon stored in the different biological compartments of complex natural communities is relevant for a range of ecosystem functions and services. Temperature-dependency of many physiological and ecological processes drives this storage capacity. As opposed to other physiological rates, the temperature-dependence of nutrient uptake by plants has, to date, not been thoroughly investigated and therefore was not explicitly included in food web models. In a meta-study, we extracted experimental data to establish the temperature-dependence of the parameters determining plant nutrient uptake. Overall, we found an increase in the maximum uptake rate, as well as the half-saturation density. As the respiration rates of plants (biomass loss) increase more strongly than the nutrient uptake rates (driving biomass gain under nutrient limitation), our results suggest that warming should decrease plant biomass. We applied these temperature-dependent nutrient uptake rates by plants to a model of a three-level food-chain composed of two nutrients, a plant pool, and an herbivore pool. Having established plant nutrient uptake rates based on real data to replace the previously used assumption of logistic growth, we were able to use realistic natural nutrient deposition rates as the input variables in this model. This mechanistic model approach allowed us to show the quantitative responses of natural communities to realistic fertilization rates for the first time. We ran the model under realistic nutrient supply scenarios based on deposition data from the literature, adding a scenario of anthropogenic fertilization. We found decreases in overall community biomass with increasing temperature, but the intensity of this decrease varied strongly depending on the nutrient supply scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of including other global change drivers besides warming, as they can mediate the temperature impact on changes in global carbon storage and thus biomass-related ecosystem services.},

Consumer–resource body size ratios between predators and their prey, and parasitoids and their hosts, have recently gained increasing attention due to their important implications for species' interaction strengths and dynamical population stability. This data set documents body sizes of consumers and their resources. We gathered body size data for the food webs of Skipwith Pond, a parasitoid community of grass-feeding chalcid wasps in British grasslands; the pelagic community of the Benguela system, a source web based on broom in the United Kingdom; Broadstone Stream, UK; the Grand Cariçaie marsh at Lake Neuchâtel, Switzerland; Tuesday Lake, USA; alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada of California; Mill Stream, UK; and the eastern Weddell Sea Shelf, Antarctica. Further consumer–resource body size data are included for planktonic predators, predatory nematodes, parasitoids, marine fish predators, freshwater invertebrates, Australian terrestrial consumers, and aphid parasitoids. Containing 16 807 records, this is the largest data set ever compiled for body sizes of consumers and their resources. In addition to body sizes, the data set includes information on consumer and resource taxonomy, the geographic location of the study, the habitat studied, the type of the feeding interaction (e.g., predacious, parasitic) and the metabolic categories of the species (e.g., invertebrate, ectotherm vertebrate). The present data set was gathered with the intent to stimulate research on effects of consumer–resource body size patterns on food-web structure, interaction-strength distributions, population dynamics, and community stability. The use of a common data set may facilitate cross-study comparisons and understanding of the relationships between different scientific approaches and models.},

In the present study, we present a novel data set comprising 3661 terrestrial (mainly soil) invertebrate respiration rates from 192 independent sources across a wide range in body masses, environmental temperatures and phylogenetic groups. Although our analyses documented power-law and exponential scaling with body masses and temperature, respectively, polynomial models identified curved deviations. Interestingly, complex scaling models accounting for phylogenetic groups were able to remove curvatures except for a negative curvature at the highest temperatures ({\textgreater}30 °C) indicating metabolic down regulation. This might indicate that the tremendous differences in invertebrate body architectures, ecology and physiology may cause severely different metabolic scaling processes.},

 populations: increased metabolic demands should strengthen pairwise

 different predator-prey pairs in temperature-controlled chambers and in a
 system of naturally-heated streams. We found consistent temperature
 dependence of attack rates across experimental settings, though the
 magnitude and activation energy of attack rate was specific to each
 predator, which varied in mobility and foraging mode. 3. We used these
 parameters along with metabolic rate measurements to estimate energetic
 efficiency and population abundance with warming. Energetic efficiency
 accurately estimated field abundance of a mobile predator that struggled
 to meet its metabolic demands, but was a poor predictor for a sedentary
 predator that operated well below its energetic limits. Temperature
 effects on population abundance may thus be strongly dependent on whether
 organisms are regulated by their own energy intake or interspecific
 interactions. 4. Given the widespread use of functional response
 parameters in ecological modelling, reconciling outcomes from laboratory
 and field studies increases the confidence and precision with which we can
 predict warming impacts on natural systems.},

	abstract = {Analysis of predator - prey interactions is a core concept of animal
 ecology, explaining structure and dynamics of animal food webs. Measuring
 the functional response, i.e. the intake rate of a consumer as a function
 of prey density, is a powerful method to predict the strength of trophic
 links and assess motives of prey choice, particularly in arthropod
 communities. However, due to their reductionist set-up, functional
 responses, which are based on laboratory feeding experiments, may not
 display field conditions, possibly leading to skewed results. Here, we
 tested the validity of functional responses of centipede predators and
 their prey by comparing them with empirical gut content data from
 field-collected predators. Our predator - prey system included lithobiid
 and geophilomorph centipedes, abundant and widespread predators of forest
 soils and their soil-dwelling prey. First, we calculated the body
 size-dependent functional responses of centipedes using a published
 functional response model in which we included natural prey abundances and
 animal body masses. This allowed us to calculate relative proportions of
 specific prey taxa in the centipede diet. In a second step, we screened
 field-collected centipedes for DNA of eight abundant soil-living prey taxa
 and estimated their body size-dependent proportion of feeding events. We
 subsequently compared empirical data for each of the eight prey taxa, on
 proportional feeding events with functional response-derived data on prey
 proportions expected in the gut, showing that both approaches
 significantly correlate in five out of eight predator - prey links for
 lithobiid centipedes but only in one case for geophilomorph centipedes.
 Our findings suggest that purely allometric functional response models,
 which are based on predator-prey body size ratios are too simple to
 explain predator - prey interactions in a complex system such as soil. We
 therefore stress that specific prey traits, such as defence mechanisms,
 must be considered for accurate predictions.},

 However, the relationship between functional response parameter estimates

 interaction strengths remains largely unexamined. In a critical first step
 to address this void, we tested for systematic effects of experimental
 duration and predator satiation on the estimate of functional response
 parameters, namely attack rate and handling time. Analyzing a large data
 set covering a wide range of predator taxa and body masses we show that
 attack rates decrease with increasing experimental duration, and that
 handling times of starved predators are consistently shorter than those of
 satiated predators. Therefore, both the experimental duration and the
 predator satiation level have a strong and systematic impact on the
 predictions of population dynamics and food-web stability. Our study
 highlights potential pitfalls at the intersection of empirical and
 theoretical applications of functional responses. We conclude our study
 with some practical suggestions for how these implications should be
 addressed in the future to improve predictive abilities and realism in
 models of predator-prey interactions.},

	abstract = {While metabolic theory predicts variance in population density within communities depending on population average body masses, the ecological stoichiometry concept relates density variation across communities to varying resource stoichiometry. Using a data set including biomass densities of 4959 populations of soil invertebrates across 48 forest sites we combined these two frameworks. We analyzed how the scaling of biomass densities with population-averaged body masses systematically interacts with stoichiometric variables. Simpliﬁed analyses employing either only body masses or only resource stoichiometry are highly context sensitive and yield variable and often misleading results. Our ﬁndings provide strong evidence that analyses of ecological state variables should integrate allometric and stoichiometric variables to explain deviations from predicted allometric scaling and avoid erroneous conclusions. In consequence, our study provides an important step towards unifying two prominent ecological theories, metabolic theory and ecological stoichiometry.},
