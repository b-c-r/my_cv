	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms driving stability in natural ecosystems is of crucial importance, especially in the current context of global change. A classic paradigm in ecology was that complex food webs (the “who eats whom” of natural ecosystems) should be unstable. This paradigm, however, was based on simple mathematical models. Throughout the last decades, scientists proposed solutions to the contradictions between the predictions of simple models and the observation of the complexity of nature. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving these stabilizing effects are still rather unexplored. Especially, exploring and predicting the reaction of natural ecosystems to changes of the environment is a pressing issue of our time. Forecasting models predicted global warming up to 8°C until 2100, also nutrient enrichment is caused by anthropogenic land use. This causes changes in species composition and may lead to species extinctions. A fundamental unit of natural ecosystems is the interaction between species. The most obvious interaction is the feeding interaction between a predator and its prey. This interaction is mainly influenced by the metabolism and the feeding rate of the predator, as well as by the population density of the prey. Combining a mechanistic understanding of these interactions and traditional population models led to ground-breaking insights into the mechanisms stabilizing food-webs. For example, a non-random distribution of feeding interactions in a food web increases its resistance against destabilizing effects. This might be caused by strong constraints introduced by the distributions of body masses across the species in a food web. Additionally, relatively weak interactions are known to have a positive effect on stability, if they occur in a specific way within small food-web motifs (e.g., a weak interaction from a top predator to the basal species and a strong interaction to its main prey, the intermediate predator). Also, models suggested that the stability of natural populations may change, if the feeding capacity and the metabolism (or the death rate) of a predator are not equally influenced by the environmental temperature. However, empirical support for this is still scarce. In this thesis, I explored the impact of body masses and environmental temperature on feeding interactions (Chapters 3.1., 3.2.\& 4.1.). Additionally, I explored the influence of these constraints on population and food-web stability by using mathematical models (Chapters 3.3., 3.4., 4.1. \& 4.2.). The body-mass dependence of metabolism generally followed the 3/4 power laws as predicted by the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (Chapter 3.1.). However, the strength of the feeding rates follows a hump-shaped curve with the body mass ratio of the predator to its prey (Chapters 3.1.\& 3.2.). This leads to the phenomenon that a predator would not be able to fulfil its metabolic demands if only insufficient small prey would be available (Chapter 3.2.). Moreover, with increasing temperature, the metabolism increases more than the ability of the predator to consume food (Chapter 4.1.). These findings have fundamental implications for food web stability. Predators only are able to exist within a given range of body mass ratios to their prey. Approximately 97\% of all tri-trophic food chains existing in natural food webs fall within this range (Chapter 3.3.). Additionally, at high body-mass ratios an additional interaction from the top predator to the basal species (omnivory) leads to a higher stability when incorporating the results from chapters 3.1. \& 3.2. into the population models. Together with the distribution of the interactions as given in natural food webs (Chapter 3.3.), omnivory motifs are stabilised within the whole range of natural body-mass ratios (Chapter 3.4.). The different temperature dependencies found for metabolism and feeding in chapter 5.1 led to more stable population cycles but may also lead to extinction events caused by starvation of the predators. In addition, warming affects the food web structure, increasing or decreasing these starvation effects, as found in chapter 4.1. Also, enrichment effects on population stability and food-web persistence can be overcome by incorporating naturally plausible feeding interactions (Chapter 5.1.). Overall, incorporating naturally relevant feeding interactions from laboratory studies into population and food-web models provides important insights into the functioning of populations and their stability in the context of food webs and their response to global change.},

	title = {Temperature and enrichment effects on simple consumer resource pairs and complex food web models},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The abiotic environment influences species and their interrelations with other species. One of the best known environmental gradients in species diversity is the latitudinal species richness gradient. This latitudinal gradient is coupled with a temperature gradient. Additionally, anthropogenic influences on global temperature and enrichment become more important for species richness. Mathematical models enabled a mechanistic understanding how nutrient enrichment increases the biomasses of species but eventually leads to extinctions (“paradox of enrichment”). Here, I present null models to predict interdependent effects of enrichment and warming on ecological community characteristics such as species richness, biomasses and population fluctuations. First, a simple consumer-resource model was simulated to understand the basic mechanistic coherences. Warming yields higher average biomasses and leads to lower relative population fluctuations irrespective of the system’s functional response. However, it decreases the extinction threshold to lower enrichment in systems with a type II functional response. Second, complex food webs models were simulated. Warming leads to higher species richness irrespective of the functional response. Systems with predator interference or sigmoidal shaped (type III) functional responses exhibit higher species richness and lower relative population fluctuations than systems with hyperbolic (type II) functional responses. Species loss trough enrichment occurs in systems with type II functional responses and is prevented in systems with predator interference or type III functional responses.
Together these results suggest that (1) warming leads to higher species richness, which is consistent with global latitudinal gradients, (2) the paradox of enrichment is prevented by predator interference or type III functional responses, and (3) complexity, warming and enrichment effects on ecological communities are interdependent. To forecast scenarios of global warming effects on local communities, further work needs to incorporate environmental niches of species into this mechanistic model.},

	abstract = {The biological world is not always linear. More precisely, relationships between changes in an external driver and the reaction of a biological system (e.g. a molecule, an organism or a complete ecosystem) is most often not linear. Some of the best known examples of this kind are the hyperbolic curve of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, its close relative, the feeding functional response by Holling, the hump shaped optimal foraging curve or the S-shaped logistic growth of isolated populations. But also other relationships that we treat as linear after a data transformation are basically non-linear. For instance the power-law relationships of metabolic rates with body mass or the exponential relationships with temperature. Especially the last is used to describe biological dependencies from the cell (e.g. metabolic rates and genetic mutation rates) to whole ecosystems (e.g. the abundance-body mass scaling of whole communities). Statistics, however, were classically bound to linear relationships that can be solved “analytically” (that means with a brain, a pen and a paper). Non-linear relationships, however, most often need iterative processes that can not be solved analytically any more, but need an extention to the human brain, the computer, to solve it.},
