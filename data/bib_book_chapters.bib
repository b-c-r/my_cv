	abstract = {All biological rates depend on temperature, as they are based on biochemical reactions. Hence, the same holds for feeding rates and their functional components. From a 'biologically relevant' scope, feeding rates increase exponentially with temperature. Recent studies suggest that this increase of feeding rates with warming is shallower than the increase in metabolism. Theoretically, this mismatch should lead to a lower numerical response of biological control agents, presumably resulting in a higher probability of insect pest outbreaks. While depending on temperature, the more complex, non-linear nature of feeding rates further implies that they are also critically dependent on prey densities (i.e. the functional response). The fundamental elements of the functional response are the capture rate and the handling time. Basically, the capture rate determines the feeding success at low densities, whereas the handling time determines the maximum amount a predator is able to consume in a given time window. Moreover, capture rates themselves can also depend on prey density, turning a hyperbolic type II into a sigmoid type III functional response. This shift in the shape of the response is introduced by refuges for the prey, among other mechanisms. Contrasting the type II functional response, type III functional responses are well known to promote stable population dynamics and community structure. Therefore, changes in habitat complexity driven by climate change might also affect feeding interactions and insect pest control. Here, we review how climate change influences the functional responses of predator-prey and parasitoid-host pairs directly via increased temperature and indirectly via changes in habitat structure. We complement our review by exploring the potential consequences of feeding relations that are altered by climate change-induced mechanisms, through the application of model simulations of such consumer-resource population dynamics.},
